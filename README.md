## Trimmer

Our 8th weekend lab:

> Build a Rails application that lets you log in via Twitter and then shows you how many tweets each of the people you follow have made in the last 200 tweets on your timeline, ordered by chattiness.

> *Bonus*: Allow you to unfollow them from this list.

We had to learn the Twitter API (admittedly the Twitter gem helped a lot) as well as OmniAuth integration.

I had a lot of fun with this project, thinking of ways to visually present the list to the user.  I realized we could fairly easily scale a visual element proportionally to the data, though since we were using Foundation instead of a fancier JS frontend, it ended up being a bit kludgey with too many variables hard-coded.  Still one of my favorite projects.
